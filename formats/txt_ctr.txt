# Crash Team Racing dynamic model format
Historically we refer to this format as .ctr. CTR-tools implements .ctr parsing via classes prefixed with Ctr in Code\ctr folder. ctr data can be found either in standalone files (kart models, podium chars) or included within the level file (crates, hazards, etc).

#common structures

// ctr file header, we refer to as "model", as it contains a single logical object

model {
	char[16] - name
	short - event/thread id (refer to decomp for more info)
	short - number of meshes
	uint - pointer to model headers

	mesh[number of meshes] - array of model headers

	//some models contain extra data here, about 0x20 bytes
	//however, no pointers to this data exists, it doesn't change the model visually and it works fine without it
	//it is unclear whether this is a part of the format, or just some garbage

	byte[] - model data, multiple arrays described in this doc after structures
}


// a single mesh entry, multiple meshes are used for LoD implementation

mesh {
	char[16] - name
	int? - unknown (always 0?) // probably some runtime pointer?
	short - lod distance
	short - mesh flags - we only know about a billboard flag (used for player position numbers)
	Vector3s - model scale // note this is PSX GTE large fixed point value (int value / (1 << 12))
	short - padding

	uint - pointer to command list
	uint - pointer to mesh frame // this is NULL if model is animated
	uint - pointer to texture layout data (same as in lev) // if there are no textures, this is still a valid pointer, same as clut.
	uint - pointer to colors (clut)
	int? - unk3 - ruins model if changed
	int? - number of animations
	uint - pointer to animations pointer map
	int? - unk4 - anything other than 0 freezes the game
}


// animation entry header

animation {
	char[16] - anim name
	short - num frames, but highest bit = frame interpolation flag.
	// if set, it means that only half of the frames are stored in the file
	short - frame size // all frames are of the same size
	uint - time deltas array, a shared array of differences, used to recover every frame vertex data
	frame[num frames] - additional data per frame
	byte[unknown length] - base anim data
}

# texture data
array of uint - pointers to texture data
array of texturelayout - struct from lev file

basically defines texture page, quad UV coords and palette.


// vertex frame

if the model is not animated there is only one vertex frame.
if it is animated, there are multiple frames.
frame data can be either raw or compressed.

frame {
	short - posX
	short - posY
	short - posZ
	short - padding (maybe some flag?)
	16 bytes - unknown, nothing changes visually
	uint - offset to verts (from the beginning of this struct, often 0x1C)
	
	// depending on pointer to deltas in the animation header
	// if NULL - it's a raw byte array, vec3b - a byte per coord
	// if not NULL, it's a compressed bitstream. refer to compressed animation data below

	vector3b[] or byte[] - vertex array or a bitstream
}

the original model is normalized to a byte vector, which results in 256 possible values per axis, scaled back to the orignal size using scale vector and moved around using the position offset. offset is applied to the compressed data values.

the final coord = ((vertex coord + offset) / 255) * scale coord


# color data (clut)
just usual 4 bytes RGBX
where X is a bitwise flag value - defines psx rendering mode


# compressed animation data
if animation is compressed, Crash Bandicoot 2 delta compression is used.

delta compression works kind of like ADPCM sound compression, when you have a base value and every next stream value somehow modified the base value, restoring the original data.

there is a shared "delta command" array used for all frames, and a frame specific bitstream array.
there is one delta command entry per vertex.

delta command {
	3 bits - Z bits (0-7)
	3 bits - Y bits (0-7)
	3 bits - X bits (0-7)

	8 bits - delta pos Z
	8 bits - delta pos Y
	7 bits - delta pos X // important, there is one bit less for X coord, so you need to left shift the value by 1
}

decompression algorithm:
- initialize base XYZ pos values with a zero.
- loop over the delta command array.
- for every coord 3bits value - if it's 7, reset base values to zero.
- take specified amount of bits from frame stream for each coord.
- calculate coord value using this formula:
  final coord = (base pos + delta command pos + extra stream bits) % 256
