ePSXe.exe+B0A4EC
exe -> 0x78CCC

Terrain definitions
size: 0x60, 16 entries

dword - pointer to string - terrain name
dword - flags (like 0x04 sets white snow trail)
4 dwords - params that affect handling
2 dwords - pointers to particle structs (like grass, snow and dirt)
3 dwords - even more values!
4 bytes - unknown smaller values (04 05 04 40)
8 words - somehow affect bots, seems to control speed as well.



ePSXe.exe+B08DA4
exe -> 0x77584

16 entries (num of players)

dword - ptr to model_name
short - char name index in lng. also changes the layout on adventure selection screen
short - short char name index in lng. probably used at save
short - texture index
short - unknown always 0
dword - char difficulty (0 - med - all equal, 1 - med - accel+ turn-, 2 - advanced, 3 - beginner) anything beyond these values screws handling.

right after this array there are 8 shorts, that's basically selected character index for every bot.
but as we already know you can only pick those loaded in memory.
