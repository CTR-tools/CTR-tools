====================================

to enable charswap support, rename this file to charswap.txt and make sure it's in the same folder with CTRFramework.dll

charswap is used to simplify the translation process for languages that may alter original font chars to represent local characters.
this example is based on russian bootleg translation by RGR

1st line - source english chars
2nd line - target language chars

if multiple chars are present, 1st entry is used by default

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
make sure you're using UTF-8. you can change encoding in notepad in save file dialog or you can use notepad++ and pick convert to UTF-8 option in encoding menu.
