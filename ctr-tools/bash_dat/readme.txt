Crash Bash file extractor, CTR-tools


This tool is able to split CRASHBSH.DAT file and extract most textures from TEX files.

1. copy both EXE and DAT file to the same folder.
2. drag drop EXE file on the tool
3. if EXE is identified as known, it will create data folder with extracted contents

Do not rely on extensions too much, it may fail, cause it's based on rough ntsc-u analysis. it may or may not match other versions partially or completely.

to extract textures, simply drag drop TEX file on the tool. it will create a folder by the same name with extracted textures. note that only 4bit textures are supported, some stuff like player icons doesn't work. also files with wrong palette are marked with "badpal" word. it's normal to have those at this point.
