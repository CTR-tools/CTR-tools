# Running CTR-Tools on linux

### Currently there is a official support for linux?
No

### There is a workaround?
Yes, there is and I will show you how I get ctr tools working on a ubuntu 19.10 (tested version)

# Dependencies

* **Wine** - https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu
* **Mono** - https://www.mono-project.com/
* **Poweriso** - https://www.poweriso.com/

Ps: I presume you have some experience with terminal, already have a PS1 emulator running, and a CTR copy (I use NTSC)

By installing those programs (they all provide tutorial for installing) restart your machine and you're good to go
