Data[2] - if it’s not 0, Data[6,7,8,9] will hold some value or 0. Could mean something per quad (since four of them). This value most of the time coincides with value of data[2]. But sometimes it can be different.

Bytes 2 and 6 7 8 9 are always same and equal?

Not always, but it’s still weird, looks like some pattern there.  Maybe like 2 denotes what mode should be applied and then 6 7 8 9 for each quad separately?

Data[3] -  to check
Data[4] - to check

data [5] could be transparency indeed.
Possible values 0 1 2 3 128 129 130 131. So it’s like there is flag at 128 and flags at 1 and 2.



unk2[1] - 0 15 30 45 60, but most of tracks have it at 0.
